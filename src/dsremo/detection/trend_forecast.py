"""Long-term trend forecasting for operator planning.

Provides days-to-limit extrapolation from STL trend:
    "At current degradation rate, battery_voltage will cross the
     warning threshold in 45 days."

Unlike the TTL prediction in detector.py (which only fires when the limit
is within 60 minutes), this module provides weeks/months forecasts for
capacity planning and maintenance scheduling.
